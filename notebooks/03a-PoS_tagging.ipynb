    "There are many words that always have the same PoS definition - maybe the word Sun, for example, is always a noun. However, there are others that can change their meaning according to the context, such as \"house\": \"I live in a house\" (noun), versus \"I like house music\" (adjective), versus \"The museums house a collection of ancient artifacts\" (verb).\n",
