    "\n",
    "You might have figured out by now that searching for words in a large collection is very inneficient. To avoid such searches, many databases implement a data structure called an \"inverted index\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The inverted index is essentially a dictionary whose key is a word from the vocabulary, and whose value is a list (or set) of references to documents that contain that word.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, the inverted index below:\n",
    "\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        'brazil' : [0, 1, 2],\n",
    "        'argentina' : [2, 3]\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "means that \"brazil\" appears in documents 0, 1, and 2, while \"argentina\" appears in documents 2 and 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might want to stem/lemmatize the words before implementing the inverted index.\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Complete the function below to generate an inverted index for a news dataframe, which will allow searching among news based on keywords. HINT: use `CountVectorizer` to save yourself some time!\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Use your inverted index to search for news documents that contain \"brazil\" AND \"president\". What does the DF distribution say in this case?\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) Use your inverted index to search for news documents that contain \"brazil\" BUT DO NOT CONTAIN \"football\" or \"soccer\". How is the DF distribution in this case?"

    "These groups of words that appear together are called \"topics\". The act of finding topics is called \"topic modelling\". One of the current state-of-the-art ideas for topic modelling is called [Latent Dirichlet Allocation](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/blei03a/blei03a.pdf), or LDA.\n",

    "\n",

The election's impact on the Amazon rainforest and poverty were also highlighted.  Evangelical Christians, particularly women of color, played a significant kingmaker role.\n",
      "* **Social Inequality:** Brazil's stark racial inequality is addressed, with black Brazilians significantly underrepresented in managerial positions.\n",
      "* **Cost of Living Crisis:**  The severe cost of living crisis is impacting many Brazilians, leading to extreme measures for survival and contributing to the political climate.\n",
      "* **Amazon:** The Amazon rainforest's future is tied to the presidential election outcome, with concerns about its preservation.\n",
      "* **Indigenous Peoples:**  The disappearance and presumed murder of journalist Dom Phillips and indigenous expert Bruno Pereira in the Amazon garnered significant international attention. The last member of an uncontacted indigenous group was also featured.\n",
      "* **Crime:**  Reports include armed robberies, a prison escape, and the murder of two men in the Amazon.  Landslides in São Paulo also resulted in fatalities.\n",
      "* **Religion:** The rise of Evangelicalism within the national football team and across the country is noted.\n",
      "* **Abortion:**  Brazil's Supreme Court's consideration of decriminalizing abortion in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy is mentioned.\n",
      "* **Racism:**  Seven people were punished for racist acts towards Real Madrid's Vinicius Jr.\n",
      "\n",

      "**Sports:**\n",
      "\n",

Pele's death dominated headlines, with tributes and retrospectives of his career.\n",
      "* **Other Sports:**  Coverage includes the Women's World Cup (Brazil's participation and Marta's final match),  England's victory over Brazil in the Women's Finalissima, and Brazilian success in surfing (Gabriel Medina).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Culture & Other:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Carnival:** The return of Rio's Carnival after the pandemic was a significant news item.\n",
      "* **Tourism:**  The impact of the cost of living crisis on tourism is implicit in some articles.\n",
      "* **Celebrity:**  A Hollywood star urged Brazilian youth to vote, while other stories involved celebrity endorsements in the presidential campaign.\n",
